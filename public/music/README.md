# Background Music

To enable background music on your website, add an MP3 file to this directory.

## Important Notes:

1. Keep the file size small (ideally under 1MB) for better performance
2. Music will only play on non-home pages and will stop when returning to the home page
3. Due to browser autoplay policies, the music may only start after user interaction with the page

## Music Attribution

If you're using music from other creators, remember to include proper attribution in your website's footer or about page.

## Troubleshooting

If you experience issues with the background music:

- Make sure the file is in MP3 format
- Try using a different MP3 file, as some encodings might not be compatible with all browsers
